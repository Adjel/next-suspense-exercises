            NOTE: In a real application, youâ€™d want to use <Link>
            here (from `next/link`) to take advantage of client-side
            routing. The reason I'm using anchor tags is because some
            CSS leaks between routes when navigating back and forth
            with <Link>.

            This isn't something you have to worry about in real apps. It only happens here because I'm using plain CSS files, rather than a more production-friendly solution like CSS Modules, CSS-in-JS, Tailwind, etc.
